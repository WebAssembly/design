# WebAssembly High-Level Goals

1. Define a portable, size- and load-time-efficient binary format to serve as a
   web compilation target which can be compiled to execute at native speed by
   taking advantage of common hardware capabilities.
2. Define a human-editable text format that is isomorphic and convertible
   to/from the binary format.
3. Design to serve as a compilation target for a growing set of source languages
   over time, starting with C/C++.
4. Design to maintain the versionless, feature-testing and backwards-compatible
   evolution story of the web; engines should not need multiple, versioned
   decoders.
5. Design and implement incrementally:
    * [v.1](V1.md) of the standard will be a Minimum Viable Product with a [polyfill][] via client-side compilation to [asm.js][] and thus run on existing browsers;
      The polyfill is expected to be very effective in practice, but may not behave identically to the native implementation in all cases.
    * subsequent versions will add more [features](EssentialPostV1Features.md) prioritized by feedback.
6. Design to execute within and integrate well with the existing web platform:
    * execute in the same semantic universe as JavaScript;
    * allow synchronous calls to and from JavaScript;
    * enforce the same-origin and permissions security policies; and
    * access browser functionality through the same Web APIs that are accessible
      to JavaScript.
7. Design to allow execution in non-browser environments.
8. Create a format which enables great [tooling](Tooling.md) people want to use.
