# Contributing to WebAssembly

WebAssembly is initially designed and implemented by browser vendors who are
interested in meeting a variaty of [use cases](UseCases.md). As design and
implementation progresses they'll need input and contributions from developers
interested in using WebAssembly.

Interested in participating? We suggest you start by:

1. Reading the [WebAssembly design][].
2. Joining the IRC channel `irc://irc.w3.org:6667/#webassembly`.

With that background understood and communication set up, feel free to
[file issues][] in the WebAssembly design repository.

As WebAssembly moves forward we expect to form an official standards body, which
will have its own contribution process to the specification.

Happy assembly!
