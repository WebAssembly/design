# Contributing to WebAssembly

WebAssembly is initially designed and implemented by browser vendors who are
interested in meeting a variety of [use cases](UseCases.md). As design and
implementation progresses they need input and contributions from developers
interested in using WebAssembly.

Interested in participating? We suggest you start by:

1. Acquainting yourself with the
   [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](CodeOfConduct.md).
2. Reading the WebAssembly [design documents][] and the [developer guide][].
3. Joining the IRC channel `irc://irc.w3.org:6667/#webassembly`.
4. Perusing the [roadmap][].

With that background understood and communication set up, feel free to:

 - [file issues][] in the WebAssembly design repository
 - [participate][] in browser implementation and tooling development

Please join the [W3C Community Group][] before sending pull requests: it provides
the legal framework that protects the work in this repository. Make sure you're 
affiliated with your company or organization in the Community Group, if any.

As WebAssembly moves forward we will form an official standards body, which
will have its own contribution process to the specification.

Happy assembly!
