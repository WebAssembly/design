# Contributing to WebAssembly

WebAssembly is initially designed and implemented by browser vendors who are
interested in meeting a variety of [use cases](UseCases.md). As design and
implementation progresses they'll need input and contributions from developers
interested in using WebAssembly.

Interested in participating? We suggest you start by:

1. Reading the [WebAssembly design][].
2. Joining the IRC channel `irc://irc.w3.org:6667/#webassembly`.

With that background understood and communication set up, feel free to
join the [W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/)
and then [file issues][] or submit pull requests to the WebAssembly design
repository. The W3C Community Group provides the legal framework that protects
the work in this repository.

As WebAssembly moves forward we expect to form an official standards body, which
will have its own contribution process to the specification.

Happy assembly!
