# Contributing to WebAssembly

Interested in contributing to WebAssembly? We suggest you start by:

* Acquainting yourself with the
   [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](CodeOfConduct.md).

* Joining the
[W3C Community Group]. Please do this before starting new proposals,
attending meetings, or making significant contributions. It provides the legal
framework that protects participants and supports standardization. And make
sure you're registered as affiliated with your company or organization in the
Community Group, if any.

* Then, you may wish to:
  - [ask questions],
  - discuss existing [phase-0 proposals] and [phase-1+ proposals],
  - attend [meetings],
  - discuss [tooling conventions],
  - or make [new proposals]!
 
If your issue or PR has not received comments, you can ping the relevant spec
editor or [champion]. It is polite to ping no more than once a week.

Happy assembly!
