## Design documents

Some of the design documents in this repository are out of date. We're
gradually working updating these documents. The following are some documents
which are fairly up to date:

 - [What does Portability mean in Wasm?](Portability.md)
 - [Design Rationale](Rationale.md)
 - [WebAssembly's Security model](Security.md)
 - [Nondeterminism in WebAssembly](Nondeterminism.md)
