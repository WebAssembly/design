# v.1

As stated in the [high-level goals](HighLevelGoals.md), v.1 is designed to be a 
Minimum Viable Product, basically on par with [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/) in terms
of functionality. This means that there are important features we *know* we want 
and need, but are post-v.1; these are in a separate [essential post-v.1 features doc](EssentialPostV1Features.md).

This document explains the contents of v.1 at a high-level.  There are also separate docs with more 
precise descriptions of:
 * the [AST semantics](AstSemantics.md) 
 * the [binary encoding](BinaryEncoding.md)
 
## Module structure
 * At the top level, a module is ELF-like: a sequence of sections which declare their type and byte-length.
 * Sections with unknown types would be skipped without error. 
 * Standardized section types:
  * module import section (see [Module imports](V1.md#module-imports) below)
  * globals section (constants, signatures, variables)
  * code section (see [Code section](V1.md#code-section) below)
  * heap initialization section (see [Heap](V1.md#heap) below)

## Code section
 * The code section begins with a table of functions containing the signatures and 
   offsets of each function followed by the list of function bodies.
  * This allows parallel and streaming decoding, validation and compilation.
 * A function body consists of a set of typed variable bindings and an AST closed under these bindings.
  * The AST is composed of two primary kinds of nodes: statements and expressions.
  * Expressions are typed; validation consists of simple, bottom-up, O(1) type checking.
  * Why not a stack-, register- or SSA-based bytecode?
    * Smaller binary encoding: [JSZap](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/jszap), 
      [Slim Binaries](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.108.1711)
    * [Polyfill prototype](https://github.com/WebAssembly/polyfill) shows simple and efficient translation 
      to asm.js.
 * Control flow is structured (no goto)
  * Simple and size-efficient binary encoding and compilation.
  * Any control flow - even irreducible - can be transformed into structured control flow with the 
    [Relooper](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/raw/master/docs/paper.pdf)
    [algorithm](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2048224&CFID=670868333&CFTOKEN=46181900), with
    guaranteed low code size overhead, and typically minimal throughput overhead (except for
    pathological cases of irreducible control flow). Alternative approaches can generate reducible
    control flow via node splitting, which can reduce throughput overhead, at the cost of
    increasing code size (potentially very significantly in pathological cases).
  * The [signature-restricted proper tail-call](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/blob/master/EssentialPostV1Features.md#signature-restricted-proper-tail-calls) 
    feature would allow efficient compilation of arbitrary irreducible control flow.
 * See the [AST Semantics](AstSemantics.md) for descriptions of individual AST nodes.

## Binary format
* The primary purposes of this format are to reduce download size and accelerate decoding,
  thus enabling even very large codebases to have quick startup times.
  * Towards that goal, the binary format will be natively decoded by the browser.
* The binary format has an equivalent and isomorphic [text format](V1.md#text-format).
* Do not try to compete with a generic compression algorithm by trying to suck out every last bit;
  assume a generic compression algorithm is applied on top of the binary encoding.
* "Given that text is so compressible and it is well known that it is hard to beat gzipped source,
  is there any win from having a binary format over a text format?"
   * Large reductions in payload size can still significantly decrease the compressed file size.
     * Experimental results from the [polyfill prototype](https://github.com/WebAssembly/polyfill) show 
       the gzipped binary format to be about 20-30% smaller than the corresponding gzipped asm.js.
   * A binary format that represents the names of variables and functions with raw indices instead of strings
     is much faster to decode: array indexing vs. dictionary lookup.
      * Experimental results from the [polyfill prototype](https://github.com/WebAssembly/polyfill) show that
        decoding the binary format is about 23x faster than parsing the corresponding asm.js source
        (using [this demo](https://github.com/lukewagner/AngryBotsPacked), comparing *just* parsing
         in SpiderMonkey (no validation, IR generation) to *just* decoding in the polyfill (no asm.js code generation).
* See the [Binary Encoding](BinaryEncoding.md) for more precise description.

## Text format
* The purpose of this format is to support:
  * View Source on a WebAssembly module, thus fitting into the Web (where every source can
    be viewed) in a natural way.
  * Presentation in browser devtools when source maps aren't present (which is necessarily the case with v.1).
  * Writing WebAssembly code directly for reasons including pedagogical, experimental, debugging, or
    optimization.
* The text format is equivalent and isomorphic to the
  [binary format](V1.md#binary-format), but at least initially isn't
  standardized: the binary format is what Web Assembly aims at standardizing.
* Given that the code representation is actually an AST, the syntax would contain nested
  statements and expressions (instead of the linear list of instructions most assembly languages have).
* There is no requirement to use JS syntax; this format is not intended to be evaluated or translated 
  directly into JS.
* TODO: there is no real proposal yet

## Code loading and imports
 * The loadable unit of WebAssembly code is a *module*.
 * WebAssembly modules can be loaded declaratively (via import on page load) or imperatively (via API call)
   and can be compiled dynamically (from bytes, as defined by the binary format).
 * A natural integration point with JS would be to have WebAssembly modules be reflected to JS
   as ES6 Modules.
   * The module interface would mostly hide whether the module was JS or WebAssembly (except for things 
     like `fun.toSource()`) and allow webapps to be naturally composed of both JS and WebAssembly modules.
   * ES6 Modules can be loaded declaratively (via imports) or imperatively (via API calls at runtime).
   * The ES6 Module API also allows dynamically generated modules (a JS module can be compiled from a string);
     building on this, WebAssembly modules could be dynamically compiled from an ArrayBuffer.
   * Just like ES6 modules, WebAssembly modules could import other modules (JS or WebAssembly); this would
     replace asm.js [FFIs](http://asmjs.org/spec/latest/index.html#external-code-and-data).
 
## Heap
 * In v.1, when a WebAssembly module is loaded, it creates a new heap.
   * The [dynamic linking](FutureFeatures.md#dynamic-linking) feature will be necessary for two
     WebAssembly modules to share the same heap (but sharing with JS is possible in v.1, see below).
 * Modules can specify heap size and initialization data (data, rodata, bss) in the 
   [heap-initialization section](V1.md#module-structure).
 * Modules can specify whether the heap is growable (via `sbrk`).
 * Modules can optionally export the heap, allowing it to be aliased by JS.
   * JS sees the exported heap as an ArrayBuffer.
   * To keep an ArrayBuffer's length immutable, resizing a module's heap detaches any existent ArrayBuffers.
 * See the [AST Semantics heap section](AstSemantics.md#accessing-the-heap) for
   more details.

## Polyfill
 * A working prototype is in the [polyfill repo](https://github.com/WebAssembly/polyfill).
 * Even before browsers ship native support for WebAssembly, users can derive
   value from the polyfill due to the decreased download size of the
   [binary encoding](BinaryEncoding.md) and minimal impact on startup performance.
 * A polyfill doesn't need to be 100% correct w.r.t the specficiation to be
   useful in practice. In the corner cases of [heap access](AstSemantics.md#accessing-the-heap)
   which fall into Undefined Behavior in C/C++ (out-of-bounds and misaligned
   access), asm.js does not have ideal semantics. To maintain good polyfill
   performance, the polyfill library will diverge from the specified WebAssembly semantics.
   * If needed, the polyfill could provide an option to ensure full correctness
     at the expense of performance, though this is not expected to be necessary
     for portable C/C++ code.
 
## Non-browser embedding
 * Host environments can define builtin modules that are implemented natively and thus be imported 
   directly by WebAssembly modules.
  * For example, a WebAssembly shell might define a builtin `stdio` library with an export `puts`.
  * Another example, in the browser, would be the WebIDL support mentioned in [future features](FutureFeatures.md).
 * Where there is overlap between the browser and popular non-browser environments, a shared spec could be 
   proposed, but this would be separate from the WebAssembly spec.
  * A symmetric example in JS would be the [Loader](http://whatwg.github.io/loader) spec, intended to be
    implemented by both browsers and node.js.
 * However, one might find a fair amount of variance between the browser and other environments
   on core APIs like network and file I/O.
 * To allow writing portable POSIX-like code (that ran in both browser and other environments), the
   WebAssembly community would develop a shared repository of WebAssembly code that mapped between a 
   POSIX-like interface and the host's builtin modules at either compile-time (#ifdefs) or run-time 
   (feature-testing and conditional loading; both v.1 features).
  * A symmetric example in JS would be the [ES6 Module Loader polyfill](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader) library.
 * The WebAssembly spec would thus not try to define any large portable libc-like library.
  * However, certain features that are core to WebAssembly semantics that are found in native libc 
    *would* be part of the core WebAssembly spec as either primitive opcodes or a special builtin 
    module (e.g., `sbrk`, `mmap`).

## Security
 * No different from a security pov than if the WebAssembly module was asm.js.
