# v.1

As stated in the [high-level goals](HighLevelGoals.md), v.1 is designed to be a 
Minimum Viable Product, basically on par with [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/).  This means 
that there are important features we *know* we want and need, but are post-v.1; these 
are in a separate [essential post-v.1 features doc](EssentialPostV1Features.md).

This document explains the contents of v.1 at a high-level.  There are also separate docs with more 
precise descriptions of:
 * the [AST semantics](AstSemantics.md) 
 * the [binary encoding](BinaryEncoding.md)
 
## Module structure
 * At the top level, a module would be ELF-like: a squence of sections which declare their type and byte-length.
 * Sections with unknown types would be skipped without error. 
 * Standardized section types:
  * module import section (see [Module imports](V1.md#module-imports) below)  
  * globals section (constants, signatures, variables)
  * code section (see [Code section](V1.md#code-section) below)
  * heap initialization section (see [Heap](V1.md#heap) below)

## Code section
 * The code section begins with a table of functions containing the signatures, 
   offsets and byte-lengths of each function followed by the list of function bodies.
  * This allows parallel and streaming decoding, validation and compilation.
 * A function body consists of a set of typed variable bindings and an AST closed under these bindings.
  * The AST is composed of two primary kinds of nodes: statements and expressions.
  * Expressions are typed; validation consists of simple, bottom-up, O(1) type checking.
  * Why not a stack-, register- or SSA-based bytecode?
    * Smaller binary encoding: [JSZap](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/jszap), 
      [Slim Binaries](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.108.1711)
    * [Polyfill prototype](https://github.com/WebAssembly/polyfill) shows simple and efficient translation 
      to asm.js.
 * Control flow is structured (no goto)
  * Simple and size-efficient binary encoding and compilation.
  * Most (reducible) goto-based control flow can be transformed into structured control flow with a 
    [relooping](http://mozakai.blogspot.com/2012/05/reloop-all-blocks.html) algorithm.
  * The [signature-restricted proper tail-call](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/blob/master/EssentialPostV1Features.md#signature-restricted-proper-tail-calls) 
    feature would allow efficient compilation of both direct and indirect goto.
 * See the [AST Semantics](AstSemantics.md) for descriptions of individual AST nodes.

## Binary format
* This is the format natively decoded by the browser.
* Do not try to compete with a generic compression algorithm by trying to suck out every last bit;
  assume a generic compression algorithm is applied on top of the binary encoding.
* "Given that text is so compressible and it is well known that it is hard to beat gzipped source,
  is there any win from having a binary format over a text format?"
   * Large reductions in payload size can still significantly decrease the compressed file size.
     * Experimental results from the [polyfill prototype](https://github.com/WebAssembly/polyfill) show 
       the gzipped binary format to be about 20-30% smaller than the corresponding gzipped asm.js.
   * A binary format that represents the names of variables and functions with raw indices instead of names
     is much faster to decode: array indexing vs. dictionary lookup.
      * Experimental results from the [polyfill prototype](https://github.com/WebAssembly/polyfill) show that
        decoding the binary format is about TODO x faster than parsing the corresponding asm.js source.
* See the [Binary Encoding](BinaryEncoding.md) for more precise description.

## Text format
* This purpose of this format is to support:
  * View source on a WebAssembly module.
  * Presentation in debugging tools when source maps aren't present (which is necessarily the case with v.1).
  * Writing WebAssembly code directly for reasons including pedagogical, experimental, debugging, or
    optimization.
* Given that the code representation is actually an AST, the text syntax would also contain nested
  statements and expressions (instead of the linear list of instructions most assembly languages have).
* There is no requirement to use JS syntax; this format is not intended to be evaluated or translated 
  directly into JS.
* TODO: there is no real proposal yet

## Code loading and imports
 * The loadable unit of WebAssembly code is a *module*.
 * WebAssembly modules can be loaded declaratively (via import on page load) or imperatively (via API call)
   and can be compiled dynamically (from bytes, as defined by the binary format).
 * A natural integration point with JS would be to have WebAssembly modules be reflected to JS
   as ES6 Modules.
   * The module interface would mostly hide whether the module was JS or WebAssembly (except for things 
     like `fun.toSource()`) would allow webapps to be naturally composed of both JS and WebAssembly modules.
   * ES6 Modules can be loaded declaratively (via imports) or imperatively (via API calls); this would allow 
     WebAssembly modules to be loaded dynamically.
   * The ES6 Module API also allows dynamically generated modules (viz., a module can be compiled froma string);
     building on this, WebAssembly modules could be dynamically compiled from an ArrayBuffer of bytes.
   * Just like ES6 modules, WebAssembly modules could import other modules (JS or WebAssembly); this would
     replace asm.js [FFIs](http://asmjs.org/spec/latest/index.html#external-code-and-data).
 
## Heap
 * In v.1, when a WebAssembly module is loaded, it always gets a new private heap.
   * The [dynamic linking](FutureFeatures.md#dynamic-linking) feature is necessary for two modules
     to share the same heap.
 * Modules can specify heap size and initialization data (data, rodata, bss).
 * Modules can specify whether the heap is growable (via sbrk) and/or aliasable by JS (via an ArrayBuffer).
 * A module's is not, semantically, a JS typed array, but it can be *aliased* by JS (if declared).
   * To keep an ArrayBuffer's length immutable, resizing a module's heap detaches any existant ArrayBuffers.
 * Modules throw on out-of-bound access.
   * A module can declare that low-memory (and how much) is to be considered out-of-bounds.
   * A stronger rule that allows slightly more optimization and tighter security would be to additionally
     "poison" the heap after any out-of-bound so that it cannot be accessed again.
 * Loads and stores are guaranteed to work when unaligned (though possibly very slowly).
 
## Function pointers
 * In v.1, function pointers are local to a single module.
   * The [dynamic linking](FutureFeatures.md#dynamic-linking) feature is necessary for two modules
     to pass function pointers back and forth.
 * Function pointers have a unique type per signature that is coercible to and from an int32.
   * The heap can only load/store integer types, so a coercion is required when loading/storing
     function pointers to the heap.
 * Values of function pointer types are comparable for equality and callable.
 * Function pointer values are created via special AddressOf ops that take a function's index
   and returns a function pointer value unique to the function index.

## Backwards compatible evolution
 * Restating the [high-level goal](HighLevelGoals.md): Design to maintain the versionless, feature-testing and 
   backwards-compatible evolution story of the web; engines should not need multiple, versioned decoders.
 * Refining this into goals:
   1. New versions of WebAssembly shouldn't require new decoders, just new cases in the existing decoder.
   2. Browsers should be able to implement and ship new features of future versions (as they do now with JS)
      without worrying about index space conflicts in the binary format (global ordering problem).
   3. WebAssembly modules should be able to test for the existence of features and either load different code
      that doesn't depend on the feature or polyfill the feature.
 * TODO: more explanation required for how to realize these goals.
 
## Non-browser embedding
 * Host environments can define builtin modules that are implemented natively and can be imported directly by WebAssembly modules.
  * For example, a WebAssembly shell might define a builtin "stdio" library with an export "puts".
  * Another example, in the browser, would be the WebIDL support mentioned in [future features](FutureFeatures.md).
 * Where there is overlap between the browser and popular non-browser environments, a shared spec could be proposed, but this would be separate from the WebAssembly spec.
  * A symmetric example in JS would be the [Loader](http://whatwg.github.io/loader) spec, intended to be implemented by both browsers and node.js.
 * However, one would expect a fair amount of variance between the browser and various shell environments on core APIs like network and file I/O.
 * To allow writing portable POSIX-like code (that ran in both browser and other environments), the WebAssembly community would develop a shared repository of WebAssembly code that mapped between a POSIX-like interface and the host's builtin modules at either compile-time (#ifdefs) or run-time (feature-testing and conditional loading; both v.1 features).
  * A symmetric example in JS would be the [ES6 Module Loader polyfill](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader) library.
 * The WebAssembly spec would thus not try to define any large portable libc-like library.
  * However, certain features that are core to WebAssembly semantics that are found in native libc would be part of the core WebAssembly spec as either primitive opcodes or a special builtin module (e.g., sbrk(), mmap()).

## Security
 * No different from a security pov than if the WebAssembly module was asm.js.
