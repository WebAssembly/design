# Upcoming Features

Subsequent versions will expose further features which expand upon the
[high-level goals][], prioritized based on developer feedback, such as:

* Concurrency and parallelism through threads and SIMD.
* Dynamic loading.
* Platform-independent Just-in-Time compilation, potentially through dynamic
  loading.
* Finer-grained control on memory management.
* Zero-cost exception handling.
* Stack unwinding.
* Garbage collection.
* Signal handling.
* Proper tail-calls.
* Irreducible control flow.
* Extra math which may not work the same on all platforms:
  - Fused multiply-add.
  - Reciprocal square-root approximate.
  - 16-bit floating-point values.
