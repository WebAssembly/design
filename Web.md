# Web Embedding

Unsurprisingly, one of WebAssembly's primary purposes is to run on the Web,
for example embedded in Web browsers (though this is
[not its only purpose](NonWeb.md)).

This means integrating with the Web ecosystem, leveraging Web APIs, supporting
the Web's security model, preserving the Web's portability, and designing in
room for evolutionary development. Many of these goals are clearly
reflected in WebAssembly's [high-level goals](HighLevelGoals.md). In
particular, WebAssembly MVP will be no looser from a security point of view
than if the module was JavaScript.

More concretely, the following is a list of points of contact between WebAssembly
and the rest of the Web platform that have been considered:

## JavaScript API

A [JavaScript API](JS.md) is provided which allows JavaScript to compile
WebAssembly modules, perform limited reflection on compiled modules, store
and retrieve compiled modules from offline storage, instantiate compiled modules
with JavaScript imports, call the exported functions of instantiated modules,
alias the exported memory of instantiated modules, etc.

## Modules

WebAssembly's [modules](Modules.md) allow for natural [integration with
the ES6 module system](Modules.md#integration-with-es6-modules).

### Names

A WebAssembly module imports and exports functions. WebAssembly names functions
using arbitrary-length byte sequences. Any 8-bit values are permitted in a
WebAssembly name, including the null byte and byte sequences that don't
correspond to any Unicode code point regardless of encoding. The most natural
Web representation of a mapping of function names to functions is a JS object
in which each function is a property. Property names in JS are UTF-16 encoded
strings. A WebAssembly module may fail validation on the Web if it imports or
exports functions whose names do not transcode cleanly to UTF-16 according to
the following conversion algorithm, assuming that the WebAssembly name is in a
`Uint8Array` called `array`:

```
function convertToJSString(array)
{
  var string = "";
  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i)
    string += String.fromCharCode(array[i]);
  return decodeURIComponent(escape(string));
}
```

This performs the UTF8 decoding (`decodeURIComponent(escape(string))`) using
a [common JS idiom](http://monsur.hossa.in/2012/07/20/utf-8-in-javascript.html).
Transcoding failure is detected by `decodeURIComponent`, which may throw
`URIError`. If it does, the WebAssembly module will not validate. This validation
rule is only mandatory for Web embedding.

## Security

WebAssembly's [security](Security.md) model should depend on the
[same-origin policy][], with [cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)][] and
[subresource integrity][] to enable distribution through content
distribution networks and to implement [dynamic linking](DynamicLinking.md).

## SIMD

Once [SIMD is supported](FutureFeatures.md#fixed-width-simd) WebAssembly would:

* Be statically typed analogous to [SIMD.js-in-asm.js][];
* Reuse specification of operation semantics (with TC39);
* Reuse backend implementation (same IR nodes).

## GC

Once [GC is supported](GC.md), WebAssembly code would be able to reference
and access JavaScript, DOM, and general WebIDL-defined objects.
